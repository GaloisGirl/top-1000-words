The index page should first say "Select a language".
Then there should be a centered vertical list of languages, read from configuration.
Let the languages be: German, Spanish, Italian, Czech and Arabic for now.
For every language, there should be a large outlined rounded button, with the appropriate emoji flag first, and the the name of the language. The font should be pretty big  Put the emoji in the config too.
