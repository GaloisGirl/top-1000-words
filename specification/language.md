A language page should first display a heading with the emoji and name of the language.
The there should be a table of the most frequent 100 words in that language, ordered from most to least frequent.
Columns should be as follow:
1. Rank
2. Word. Give a yellow background for nouns, green for verbs and blue for adjectives.
3. Part of peach. Only display an abbreviation. 
4. Gender, empty if not applicable.
5. A speaker icon, not functional for now.
6. Translaton. At first, the translation should not be displayed, there should be an eye icon instead. When the user clicks that eye, the translation should be revealed.
